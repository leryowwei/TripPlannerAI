      <td>[What is it? Singapore’s oldest and most popular nature park with lush rainforest bordering the country’s first reservoir and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.Why go? MacRitchie Reservoir is a haven for joggers, families and weekend strollers with trails around the reservoir ranging from three to 11-kilometres in length, from easy treks to ambitious hikes that can go up to five hours long for a round trip. One of the highlights of the reserve is the TreeTop Walk which features a 250-metre suspension bridge connecting the two highest points of the nature reserve, offering panoramic views across the treetops.Don’t miss: It's also a sanctuary for a type of monkey that is native in Southeast Asia – the crab-eating macaque. While it's friendly by nature, you're encouraged not to feed them. The nature reserve also has turtles and other jungle creatures crawling around.]</td>
