This sherbet goes into making a gin-based drink called Portofino. Time Out tip Try the bar's signature cocktail, the (Not) Classic PBJ that highlights Chinese kumquats that are caramelised into a liqueur and combined with a peanut butter fat-washed Glenfiddich 15 whisky – a sweeter, richer take on an Old Fashioned that goes down easy.]</td>

Besides hundreds of animal and insect species, it also contains more tree species than the whole of North America. Weekends are busy with walkers, nature lovers and mountain bikers, so come on a weekday if you prefer a quiet trek. There are four walking trails. A steep paved path takes you directly to the peak, but more interesting are the unpaved trails; route 3 (green) follows a winding forest path, past caves used by Japanese soldiers in World War II. Look out for long-tailed macaques, squirrels and snakes, and listen for the incessant ‘chonk-chonk’ of the striped tit-babbler. Cyclists should wear protective gear as the biking trail is extremely rugged. ]</td>

It stretches for 10-kilometres from the Lower Pierce Reservoir to the Kallang Basin. Why go? It used to be home to the sea nomads who lived on boats in the Kallang Basin and pledged allegiance to Temenggong Abdul Rahman of the Johor-Riau Sultanate. Today, you'll find canoes and dragon-boats instead. Don't miss: Catch a glimpse of Singapore's royal family – the otters. They're a busy bunch – swimming, eating and being photographed. Try spotting them at Kallang River, next to the MRT station where the Bishan clan usually hangs out.]</td>

From that vantage point, you’ll be able to snap a panorama of the Singapore mainland. ]</td>

While it's friendly by nature, you're encouraged not to feed them. The nature reserve also has turtles and other jungle creatures crawling around.]</td>

This year, a total of 44 restaurants have been conferred that elusive star – or, as the French call it, 'macaroon' – by the epicurean manual. The guide uses five criteria to assess these restaurants: mastery of technique; quality of ingredients; chef's personality; value for money; and consistency.The list leans towards fine-dining restaurants that offer degustation menus that often cost upwards of $100, however, it also names some hawkers and casual dining spots like Putien if you don't want to break the bank. Alternatively, head over to this list of restaurants that earned a Bib Gourmand award, Michelin-recommended meals that cost less than $45.RECOMMENDED: Read our guide on the 50 best restaurants and 50 best bars in Singapore]</td>

Visitors must climb flights of stairs to get to the summit, where they’ll find the tranquil oasis of Pearl’s Hill Reservoir. This fortress-like structure was built in 1898 to supply drinking water to Chinatown, which it still does today. Along the way, relax under the shade of mature tembusu trees and breathe in the sweet perfume from the pink and white blooms of frangipani trees. On your way back down toward Eu Tong Sen Street, a little exploring will uncover more relics from colonial times – like a cannon sitting alongside a five-storey blue building. This is one of a pair of Neo-Classical-style conservation buildings built in 1935 – the Upper and Lower Barracks that once housed the Straits Settlements Police’s Sikh contingent.Nearest MRT station: Outram Park]</td>

There you find everything from the old traditional Singapore breakfast kaya toast (toast with coconut jam) and kopi (coffee), to Indian roti (bread), noodles, and roasted duck.After all this food for breakfast, go for a walk around the stunning Botanic Garden. For me, the highlight is the National Orchid Garden (opening hours: 08:30-19:00), the largest display of orchids in the world. Orchid is my favorite flower, so I love walking around in this part of the Botanic Garden.We love going for a stroll in the stunning Botanic Garden SingaporeThe Ginger Garden part of Botanic Garden is also beautiful and houses the atmospheric Halia restaurant with several ginger-based dishes on the menu. The Learning Forest with its elevated walkways and boardwalks is the newest part of the Botanic Garden. It has a cool canopy web where you can lay down and listen to the sounds of the forest.

You’d never guess that this green space exists, wrapping around one of the most populous neighbourhoods in Singapore. Wade through the greens as you take on the walking trail within the sanctuary to uncover its rich biodiversity, featuring many species of birds, butterflies, dragonflies and spiders. Sit on one of the rustic wooden benches while you admire the marshes and listen to the unique sounds of wild birds – and the expressway. Only in Singapore, eh? No cycling is allowed in the park, though, but you can either push your bike along the trail or leave them at the designated parking spots nearby. There is also no public parking at the park so if you're driving, you have to park the car at the nearby HDB estate and make your way by foot. The park is mostly left untouched so you might need to put on some proper trekking shoes to conquer the – sometimes – muddy trails and bring along some insect repellent for pesky mozzies. ]</td>

Be wowed by the weird and wondrous mata-mata, fearsome alligator snapping turtles, and one 60-year-old Asian pond turtle. There’s even a double-headed, six-legged amphibian that the museum owners claimed to have found in their courtyard and nursed back to health. \r\nKids can head to the petting corner, where they’ll get up-close and personal with some of the gentler critters. Look out for the tiny terrapins and soft shell tortoises roaming freely through the park – you can give them a pat on the shell or feed them. ]</td>

Its guest rooms feature bathrooms with lovely rainshowers and private balconies looking out onto greenery. All the charming details you’d find in an elegant British bungalow in Singapore circa 1930 – like blinds, rattan chairs and shutters – are included (with fresh updates, of course), so being here is like a sojourn into another era. There’s also a bar-bistro with seats spread out on a verandah – perfect for mid-afternoon mimosas. The hotel sits near the peaceful Changi Chapel and Museum and underrated Changi Beach Park, in case you want to have a stroll.Nearest MRT station: Tanah Merah]</td>

Each trail takes you on a sightseeing tour to see ferns, ruins, macaques, streams and the Raffles' banded langur – a highly elusive and endangered monkey. Other wildlife residing in this reserve also includes the Sunda pangolin and the Malayan porcupine but you have to be extremely lucky to spot them in the wild. The nature park also houses a former Hainan village in Singapore and visitors can get a glimpse of this from the ruins and rubble that has been left behind from its heydays in the 60s. See the remnants of a rambutan plantation, a farm and several old village houses (one of them used to belong to the family behind popular Singapore eatery, Han's). Old street signs have also been left untouched so you're literally walking through an old kampung in 1960s Singapore. ]</td>

Singapore is a shopper’s paradise, with shopping malls galore and more brand names than you can imagine. For high street fashion and designer labels, your first stop should be Orchard Road, the highest concentration of shopping malls in the world. If you are short on time, then your best bet for a one-stop shopping mall experience is ION Orchard. This eight storey mega-mall has an entrance directly from Orchard MRT Station and boasts one of the best food courts in town, in addition to many other restaurants. The shops cover everything from big designer brand names to high street favourites. Linked via underground walkways are both Wisma Atria, for more high street favourites, and Ngee Ann City for those big designer brands again. The Mandarin Gallery bucks the trend, housing several independent boutiques. Away from Orchard, the best shopping malls are Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, home to several exclusive boutiques and jewellery shops, and VivoCity in the west, a huge mall with high street shops, two supermarkets, plenty of eating options and a multi-screen cinema. For souvenirs, head to Pagoda Street in Chinatown where the street markets are brimming with ideas for gifts. Behind the street stalls, you’ll find a few shops with attractive ranges of antique furniture and lacquer ware. Little India is also worth heading to for silk sari material, Hindi music CDs, jewellery and other ethnic gifts. Haji Lane, one of Singapore’s best kept secrets is full of independent boutiques, while the Funan IT mall is where to head for electronics, with five floors of electronic shops to keep you occupied. ]</td>

It’s crispy on the edges and has more folds than an origami crane, within which you’ll find layers of onions, eggs and meat. If it’s briyani you’re after, Zam Zam makes its version Hyderabadi dum style: the meat is cooked together with the orange-flecked basmati, which makes the rice that much more fragrant. ]</td>
